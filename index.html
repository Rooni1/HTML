        <h2>News From Apple </h2>
        <p> 
            Apple last week released the first public beta of this year’s macOS upgrade, “Monterey.”
             Unlike in 2020, this time Apple met its self-imposed deadline, releasing the beta July 1. 
             Last year, Apple declared it would issue a public beta for “Big Sur” in July but didn’t come 
             through until August. To obtain the preview, Mac users must enroll with Apple’s beta program — 
             Apple ID required — then install the upgrade 
             (using About this Mac > Software Update from the Apple menu).

                    <h2> Apple IT admins gain new tech support tool from Moysle </h2>
                    <h4>The new feature for supporting remote workers comes amid a flurry of 
                        activity in the ‘Apple in the enterprise’ market. </h4>

                        Apple’s growing place in enterprise IT means solutions providers servicing that market segment 
                        are seeing fast growth.Screen View for remote admin One of the larger MDM firms in the Apple/enterprise 
                        space, Mosyle,has introduced Screen View, a new feature to help IT admins provide highly secure support. 
                        This new feature lets IT use any device logged into Mosyle’s Admin Portal to view the screen of any macOS,
                        iOS, or iPadOS device managed by the organization. That’s a useful trick when attempting to deliver tech 
                        support, advice, or training. To protect privacy and security, the feature uses a fully encrypted peer-to-peer 
                        connection between each device, so data remains private and is not transmitted over or stored on Mosyle’s servers.

                        IT teams and administrators are stretched thin, managing and supporting countless devices, applications and systems,” 
                        said Mosyle founder and CEO Alcyr Araujo in a press release. He said his company is committed to consolidating and automating 
                        the steps it takes to manage, protect, and support Apple devices at work and school.Mosyle’s news comes as the Apple in the enterprise 
                        market experiences a flurry of activity.

            <h2> Great productivity tips for Chrome</h2>
            <h4> Save time and get more done with these handy tricks for the Google Chrome browser.</h4>
            <img src="Images/chrome_logo.jpg" alt="">
            <p> 
                In your workday, you probably spend more time using your browser than any other application.
                And you probably waste more time using your browser than you do any other application as well.
                Inefficient web browsing is one of the biggest productivity-sappers there is.If you’re a Google 
                Chrome user, help is on the way. We’ve got tips that will help you make your time browsing the web
                far more productive — everything from opening your most important sites automatically every time you 
                start Chrome, to organizing important sites into tab groups so you can get back to them more easily,
                to tapping into Chrome’s many hidden powers.[ Related: Chrome vs. Edge vs. Firefox: Which is the best 
                browser for business? ]These tips were written for Chrome in Windows, but most work in macOS, Linux, and, 
                naturally, Chrome OS as well. Some also work in the Chrome mobile apps.So fire up Chrome and let’s begin.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Organize your browsing with tab groups If, like plenty of people, you keep multiple tabs open in Chrome as 
                you’re browsing the web and doing research, you know how hard it is to find the tab with the exact information 
                you want. Chrome has an answer for that: tab groups help you keep everything organized so you can get to the site 
                you want with only a few clicks. The feature lets you group web sites into different categories — for example, one 
                about a product launch and another for economic research. Rather than seeing dozens or more open tabs, you only see 
                your groups. You can then open a group and see the site you want right away. It’s a little bit like Microsoft Edge’s 
                Collections feature.To use it, right-click a tab for a website you want to put into a group. Select Add tab to new 
                group, then type in a name for the group and choose a color. Create as many groups as you want in this way. To put a 
                tab into an existing group, right-click the tab, select Add tab to group, and select the group to which you want to 
                add the tab. To remove a tab from a group, right-click it and select Remove from group.
    
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Send a link to highlighted text on a web page If you find yourself wanting to share text from a web page with 
                others, you’ll appreciate this tip: It lets you quickly send a link to someone that sends them straight to the text
                 you want them to read, provided they use Chrome as well. To do it, highlight the text you want to share, then 
                 right-click it and select Copy link to highlight. That creates the link and puts it into your clipboard. Copy the 
                 link from your clipboard and send it to someone. When they click on it, they’ll be sent to the section of the web
                  page with the text you want to share — and the text will be highlighted in yellow.
